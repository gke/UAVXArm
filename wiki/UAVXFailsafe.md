# UAVX Failsafe Operation #

Modern receivers have failsafe capability where the channel values go to a defined state if the transmitter signal is lost. It is IMPORTANT to set the failsafe values to something sensible e.g. what all of the switches would have to be for a RTH. Remember UAVX will attempt to do what the receiver commands.
